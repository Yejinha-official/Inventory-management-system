# Inventory management System 
Inventory management System with Excel, VBA
 
## 1️⃣ Purpose
- Tracking receiving and forwarding company's equipments history (ex. laptops , monitors .. )
- Easily checking inventories of equipments.
* While I was working at a startup, there's no system for managing company's equipments inventory.  
All the managements were made by hand so that it could not be tracked or managed efficiently.  
The company had no plan to buy a inventory management software which could solve this problem, so I designed and developed by Excel & VBA.  

## 2️⃣ Used Technology
- [ ] Excel
- [ ] VBA
### *Why I chose EXCEL & VBA?*
Inventory managament is basically a form of table.   
And Excel is the most well-known and easy to handle tool for dealing with data in a table form.   
I add a bit of if-condition and for-loop by VBA so that it can handle conditional actions.
