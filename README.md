# simpleClosetManagement
Simple Closet Management System with Excel, VBA

## Purpose
- Tracking receiving and forwarding company's equipments history (ex. laptops , monitors .. )
- Easily checking inventories of equipments.
* While I was working at a startup, there's no system for managing company's equipments inventory.  
All the managements were made by hand so that it could not be tracked or managed efficiently.  
The company had no plan to buy a inventory management software which could solve this problem, so I made it by Excel.
